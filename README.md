H1B Disclosure Dataset: Predicting the case Status

Problem Statement:
The H-1B Dataset selected for this project contains data from employer’s Labor Condition
Application and the case certification determinations processed by the Office of Foreign Labor
Certification (OFLC) where the date of the determination was issued on or after October 1,
2016, and on or before June 30, 2017.
The Labor Condition Application (LCA) is a document that a prospective H-1B employer files
with U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration (DOLETA) when it
seeks to employ nonimmigrant workers at a specific job occupation in an area of intended
employment for not more than three years.
The goal for this project is to predict the case status of an application submitted by the employer
to hire non-immigrant workers under the H-1B visa program. The employer can hire
non-immigrant workers only after their LCA petition is approved. The approved LCA petition is
then submitted as part of the Petition for a Non-immigrant Worker application for work
authorizations for H-1B visa status.
